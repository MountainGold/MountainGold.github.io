I was trained as a computer scientist, but my
[research group](/collaborators/) has diverse interests 
in natural language processing, and we work on many problems in 
this area, from theoretical to empirical. We tend to focus on basic 
curiosity-driven research in areas that aren't yet well understood, in 
order to improve the foundations of the field. We view NLP as an
interdisciplinary field, and to do interdisciplinary research, you need a 
discipline. So I look for collaborators from mathematics, machine learning,
computer science, and linguistics. I don't expect you to be an expert in 
all of these fields---few people are---but I do expect you to learn 
something about all of them from a diverse of group of collaborators.

## Prospective PhD students

**I am no longer taking students for 2019.** Beyond that I expect to take
one or two students per year.

Interest in natural language processing is skyrocketing. There are some
good things about this, but a downside is that I'm no longer able to 
respond personally to every prospective student who is interested in
working with me. In fact, there's a good chance that you're reading
this because I referred you to this page. I don't do this to discourage
you---please apply! I wrote this advice page to help you: it
summarizes the advice that I used to discuss with applicants individually, 
and I keep it up-to-date.

### Naming me as a potential supervisor on your application

Many prospective students ask whether they can name me as a supervisor.
Yes, please list me as a potential supervisor if the research topics
below look interesting to you. When you name me as a potential supervisor,
your application will be routed to me during the admissions process.

You can name multiple potential supervisors on your application, and 
generally this is fine, since many of us in the 
[EdinburghNLP group](http://edinburghnlp.inf.ed.ac.uk/) have
overlapping interests, and in practice we often forward applications
to our colleagues when we think they will be of interest. (But don't list 
everyone indiscriminately---focus on those whose interests are most closely 
aligned to yours.) 

### General advice on the research proposal

To apply, you must write
a research proposal. The School of Informatics advises you to contact
prospective supervisors prior to applying, to discuss the topic of your
proposal. Unfortunately, **I cannot advise you  on your research 
proposal** due to the sheer number of applicants interested in natural
language processing. But if you name me as a potential supervisor, then your 
application will then be routed to me and I will read your proposal during 
the normal admissions cycle, which takes place early in the calendar year. 

Some applicants stress over the research proposal because they worry that
they need to commit to a four-year plan before even starting the PhD. Don't
worry about this: **your research proposal is not a contract**. I realize that 
your interests will change over the course of a PhD, and even between the 
time of the application and your first day of a PhD program. 

At the same, **take the research proposal seriously!** The proposal is an 
exercise in persuasion and scientific communication. It should convince 
the admissions committee that you can find interesting scientific questions 
and plausible ways to answer them. Pick a question that you think is 
interesting and show that it is worthwhile, unanswered, and possibly 
answerable within a few years. To show that it’s unanswered, use evidence 
from the current scientific literature. To show that it might be 
answerable, sketch a plausible 2--3 page plan for answering it. (A longer
proposal is not more impressive.) I
understand that your interests and plans will change over the course of a
PhD, so nothing you write is set in stone. It’s just the opening of a 
conversation about your interests. I also realize that you may not have
written anything like this before, and that not everyone has the same
access to opportunities. I am looking for something that shows you've
done the best you can with the opportunities available to you.

### Research topics

I'm open to a wide variety of proposals in my areas of interest. To get
an idea of what these are, I recommend that you do some [reading](/papers/)
to see how my group approaches research problems. My current research
interests are best reflected in the papers from the last few years---if you
find something exciting in that set, then we likely have some interests in common. But
below are some ideas to get you started.

Natural language understanding systems confront a menagerie of complex and 
subtle phenomena. Deep learning is a useful tool in building these 
systems, but it’s only one tool among many, and we don't fully 
understand its power or its flaws. My group aims to improve our 
understanding; here are some examples:

* Deep learning researchers [claim](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N13-1090)
that their models learn to represent linguistic properties of language 
without any explicit guidance. But [recent work in machine learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03530) 
suggests that deep models are simply very good at memorizing local 
correlations. **What do these models really learn about language?** The goal
of projects in this area is to first 
understand what, when, and how deep learning models learn about language; 
we're interested in both mathematical perspectives on learning and 
generalization, and linguistic or cognitive perspectives on what phenomena 
[are](http://aclweb.org/anthology/W18-5417) or [aren't](http://aclweb.org/anthology/D18-1278) 
acquired from text or [speech](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01431). 
We also want to understand what [cultural biases](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.09457) 
or latent [demographic information](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.06640) these
models learn, in order to understand the social implications of their 
rapidly increasing use.

* For a system to understand a text and answer questions about it, the 
system must distill the meaning of the text into a set of facts (semantic 
parsing). We can represent these facts as a graph: entities and events 
become nodes, and relationships between them become edges. We now have 
datasets that pair text with such graphs, and we'd like to learn a semantic 
parser from this data, so we need to model graphs.**How do
we design and use deep probabilistic models of graphs?** To really answer this 
question, we'll need to combine insights from recent [empirical](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03324) [work](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.05286
) with a 
web of untested [theoretical](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/COLI_a_00309) [work](http://aclweb.org/anthology/W17-3410), 
and we'd like to systematically explore the space.

I'm interested in many other things involving language, structure, and 
learning. To get a sense of what some of those things are, you can 
[read some of my recent papers](/papers/). I am happy to 
discuss *specific* questions or ideas related to my published work---if
you write to tell me that you liked one of my papers, without any questions
of your own, then the only response I can give you is to refer you back to 
this page. Again, I don't do this to discourage you---it's just the best
I can do.

Across all topics, **I am especially interested in multilingual approaches** 
that work well across different languages. Meaning can be expressed in 
many very different ways.

If you're interested in natural language, but not these specific topics, 
you may want to contact other members of 
[EdinburghNLP](http://edinburghnlp.inf.ed.ac.uk/index.php/people/)
or browse [PhD topics](http://www.ilcc.inf.ed.ac.uk/study/possible-phd-topics-in-ilcc)
they have proposed.
If you aren't genuinely interested in language, then my research group is 
not a good fit for you, and you should contact a different
supervisor in the 
[School of Informatics](http://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/).

### How to apply

**You cannot apply by emailing your documents to me.** You must use
the university's common application system, which you can find in the
application guidance links below. I 
advise students in two different programs:

* PhD students in the [Institute for Language, Cognition, and Computation](http://www.ilcc.inf.ed.ac.uk/). This is a three-year research-only program. [Read the application guidance](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc/study-with-us).
* PhD students in the [Centre for Doctoral Training in Natural Language Processing](https://edinburghnlp.inf.ed.ac.uk/cdt). This is a new four-year program combining research and some formal taught elements. [Read the application guidance](https://edinburghnlp.inf.ed.ac.uk/cdt/apply/)

You can apply to multiple programmes concurrently. (But please only apply to
programmes that you are _genuinely interested in_. Applicants who submit
to many unrelated programmes across schools and colleges are routinely rejected
because they don't appear to be committed to any particular area of study,
and a PhD definitely requires that commitment.) 
Read more about the application process
[here](http://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/postgraduate/apply).

### Self-funded students

If you have full funding from a fellowship that will pay for your tuition
and a living stipend, that's great! The purpose of your fellowship is to
enable you to pursue your intellectual interests, and if we have interests
in common, I'm happy to discuss them with you. Having a fellowship makes
admissions easier because it isn't contingent on funding, but **it is still
crucial that we have mutual research interests**. If you have a fellowship,
but you want me to advise you on a topic that is very far from my interests,
I will decline---such an arrangement wouldn't benefit either of us.

**I do not take self-funded PhD students who pay out of their own pockets.** This
would be unethical on at least two counts: (1) it gives unequal access; and 
(2) the university benefits from the labor of PhD students through their 
research and publications, and PhD students should be paid for this.

Practically, this means that we only offer admission to students we can
fund, or who are able to obtain a fellowship. I am acutely aware that this 
means that I can't work with many good applicants, but I will not make 
exceptions. 

### When to apply 

I usually only review applications in winter admissions cycle.
For a September start, apply by the second week of December in
the preceding year. **For the 2019 intake of the new 
[CDT in NLP](https://edinburghnlp.inf.ed.ac.uk/cdt), apply by the 29th of March).**
That is not a hard deadline, but applying by then ensures that the school will 
consider you for funding, which is crucial since we only make funded offers
(unless you have a full outside scholarship).  

### Chances of admission

**I cannot advise you on your chances of admission**, which depend on factors 
outside your control or even mine. Graduate admissions is a very stochastic 
process, so I advise you to apply widely.

## Prospective MSc, MScR, or MPhil students

**Do not contact me if you are applying for one of these degrees.**
I have no influence over who is admitted or whether they will work 
with me.

Longer explanation: Taught MSc programmes in Edinburgh are very intensive 
and you will not have time on the side to join a research project. A third 
of the overall credits for the MSc come from an individual project, 
supervised by a member of staff, and you will need to devote all of your 
effort to your project. Projects are assigned early in semester 2, and
though the assignment considers your preferences, there is no guarantee that
you will get your preferred project due to the very large numbers of
students. Because of all the uncertainties around this process, I can make 
no guarantee that you will be able to work with me if you join our taught 
MSc programme. As a practical matter, MSc admissions are handled centrally
and I have no influence over them.

Our department does not admit students directly to MPhil or MScR degrees. 

## Current students in Edinburgh

If you're interested in working with me and you are a current research 
student in a PhD or CDT, please get in touch!

If you are an MSc, MInf, or undergraduate honours student, the most likely
way for us to work together is during your thesis project. You are welcome
to contact me during the allocation phase for these projects. However, 
allocation is not decided by me, so I cannot make any guarantees.

## Prospective interns and visitors

**I do not currently have any openings for internships.** When I do, 
I will list them here. Please do not send me an unsolicited application. 

## Prospective visitors

**I will not host visiting scholars who I do not know personally.**

If you are already visiting the university I am happy to talk about research. 

## Prospective Postdocs

**I do not currently have any openings for postdocs.**
