Hi, I am Yilun Xu. I just obtained my Bacheorâ€™s degree from EECS dept at Peking University, where I had the privilege of working with [Yizhou Wang](http://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/faculty/adjunct/wangyizhou/index.htm), [Yuqing Kong](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/yuqkong/) and [Stefano Ermon](https://cs.stanford.edu/~ermon/). I will attend MIT for my PhD study this Sept.
 
My research interests are machine learning. Previously, I mainly focus on bridging information theory and machine learning.
