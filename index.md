Hi, I am Yilun Xu. I just obtained my Bacheorâ€™s degree from Turing Class in EECS dept, Peking University. I had the privilege of working with [Yizhou Wang](http://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/faculty/adjunct/wangyizhou/index.htm) and [Yuqing Kong](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/yuqkong/) in PKU, and [Stefano Ermon](https://cs.stanford.edu/~ermon/) in Stanford. I will attend MIT for my PhD study this Sept.
 
My research interests are machine learning. Previously, I mainly focus on bridging information theory and machine learning.
